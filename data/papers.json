    "abstract": "A liquid\u2013solid dual-phase magnetoactive microlattice metamaterial composed of flexible 3D-printed polymer shell and magnetorheological (MR) fluid has been designed and fabricated. The MR fluid-filled magnetoactive microlattices demonstrated remarkable recoverability (~50%) and be substantially stiffened in the presence of a magnetic field, with an ~200% increment in stiffness at 60 mT. Based on specific applications, the mechanical properties of this magnetoactive microlattice metamaterial can be modulated on demand, leading to certain programmable stress-strain behavior. Active metamaterials with shapes or mechanical properties that can be controlled remotely are promising candidates for soft robots, flexible electronics, and medical applications. However, current active metamaterials often have long response times and short ranges of linear working strains. Here, we demonstrate magnetoactive microlattice metamaterials constructed from 3D-printed, ultra-flexible polymer shells filled with magnetorheological (MR) fluid. Under compressive stress, the magnetorheological fluid develops hydrostatic pressure, allowing for a linear compression strain of more than 30% without buckling. We further show that under a relatively low magnetic field strength (approximately 60\u2009mT), the microlattices can become approximately 200% stiffer than those in a relaxed state, and the energy absorption increases ~16 times. Furthermore, our microlattices showed an ultra-low response time with \u201cfield on\u201d and \u201cfield off\u201d times of ~200\u2009ms and ~50\u2009ms, respectively. The ability to continuously tune the mechanical properties of these materials in real time make it possible to modulate stress\u2012strain behavior on demand. Our study provides a new route toward large-scale, highly tunable, and remotely controllable metamaterials with potential applications in wearable exoskeletons, tactile sensors, and medical supports.",

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring materials are often disordered, with their bulk properties being challenging to predict from the structure, due to the lack of underlying crystalline axes. In this paper, we develop a digital pipeline from algorithmically-created configurations with tunable disorder to 3D printed materials, as a tool to aid in the study of such materials, using electrical resistance as a test case. The designed material begins with a random point cloud that is iteratively evolved using Lloyd's algorithm to approach uniformity, with the points being connected via a Delaunay triangulation to form a disordered network metamaterial. Utilizing laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing with stainless steel 17-4 PH and titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, we are able to experimentally measure the bulk electrical resistivity of the disordered network. The effective resistance of the structure calculated from the combinatorial weighted graph Laplacian is in good agreement with experimental data. However, the effective resistance is sensitive to anisotropy and global network topology, preventing a single network statistic or disorder characterization from predicting global resistivity.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a tunable, water-based S-band metamaterial realized with 3D printing technology and not requiring metallic materials is presented. The proposed structure is capable of reconfiguring between Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) and Radar Absorbing Material (RAM) behaviors, two electromagnetic solutions required in a wide range of applications. The main challenge herein addressed lies in achieving both AMC and RAM configurations by conceiving a 35 mm thick single structure with tunable properties without employing metals and resorting only to Polylactic Acid (PLA) and water, opportunely loaded with sodium chloride (NaCl). The dielectric characteristic of the PLA has been evaluated using a waveguide technique finding a dielectric permittivity of 2.61 and a tangent loss of 0.0327. A multilayer metamaterial structure is designed by exploiting the transmission line equivalent circuit modeling. The switching capability is ensured by controlling the salted water filling of the most external PLA cavity. Accurate numerical simulations carried out with a commercial full-wave software and experimental measurements performed by characterizing the 3D printed prototype within a waveguide demonstrated an excellent agreement and confirmed the validity of the design process. For a normal incidence, the obtained AMC bandwidth is approaching 60% within the S-band, with a maximum loss peak of 3 dB, while the RAM shows a -10 dB absorption fractional bandwidth of 42% centered at 2.8 GHz. The absence of metallic materials in the proposed solution represents a significant advantage compared to traditional AMC/RAM configurations including grounded metallic Frequency Selective Surface patterns in all the applications requiring a high angle stability, where interferences with other devices must be avoided or it is preferrable an environmentally friendly approach.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a 3D transmitting cylindrical conformal meta-lens is proposed, as a height-to-phase controlled system for electromagnetic beam manipulation, namely beam-steering. The full structure is composed of 79 independently tunable metaatoms columns, using 3D printing, providing full 360\u00b0 phase compensation. CST Microwave Studio is used for both the unit cell and full structure analysis, where a standard horn antenna is used to illuminate the 3D meta-lens. The far-field beam-steering mechanism of the proposed antenna is achieved by calculating the required phase compensations for each column of meta-atoms, to redirect the beam to a predefined angle. Simulation results show two unique beam scanning techniques, one for a single beam and the other one for a dual-beam steering, at different angles of 0\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 30\u00b0, and 45\u00b0, and this capability can be further extended to enable wider 2D beam scanning, with independent beam deflection for the dual-beam functionality, making the proposed meta-lens a potential low-cost candidate for high-gain beam steering mm-wave wireless communication systems.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing has proven to be a reliable and quick method for creating devices and tools. One example is 3D\u2010printed nasal swabs that require robust mechanical strength while maintaining adequate flexibility. However, there is a lack of detailed understanding on the mechanical response of tubular structures under torsion loading. The goal of this work is to understand the torsional behavior of a group of 3D\u2010printed tubular metamaterials. The idea of mechanical metamaterials is used and it is started with a rectangular lattice. Two main design methods are used: reinforced lattices and compliant lattices. First, diagonal reinforced beams are added to enhance the torsional rigidity. Furthermore, pre\u2010buckling is added to the straight beam, creating a flexible structure that increases the maximum torsional resistance. The experiments demonstrate that the sponge\u2010inspired design exhibits enhanced stiffness approximately 21 times that of baseline tubular designs. Moreover, the strength and toughness of the sponge\u2010inspired design are approximately 2.5 and 3 times higher. By curving the beam, compliant tubulars are created. The torsional angle is increased by at least 2.7 times, while the torsional toughness can reach up to 17 times. Using these two design strategies helps in creating tubular metamaterials with varied applications.",

    "abstract": "The paper proposes a class of tunable metamaterials that use inclined beams to achieve instability in a rigid system. Three different beam tilt angles, 25\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0, are evaluated in the form of unit cells using quasi-static compression tests and numerical simulations. Snap-through behavirous are characterised by structural stiffness and buckling load. Periodic and gradient structures are assembled and analysed by arranging the unit cells in rows and columns. Size effect analyses and parametric studies are carried out on various unit-cell arrangements and different beam angles. The proposed metamaterials are manufactured through fused filament fabrication 3D printing technology with a composite material, onyx. The results from experiments, finite element analysis, and analytical models are compared and evaluated. The structural stiffness and buckling load are shown to be positively related to the inclination angle of the tilted beams. The number of rows of unit cells governs the nonlinear mechanical response (number of snap-throughs) of multiple-layered structures. By increasing the number of rows and columns of unit cells, which are less prone to manufacturing defects, the reliability and repeatability of the structural properties of periodic/gradient structures could be improved. A design plot is also provided to predict and tune the snap-through behaviour of multiple-layered structures via beam angles and unit-cell arrangements.",

Most of the current designs possess QZS property using a combination of positive stiffness element with negative stiffness element, increasing the complexity of the model. In the present research, a single-element mechanical metamaterial is tailored to obtain the QZS property. The building block consists of a single elastically-deformed beam, and the static results of the 3D-printed metastructure demonstrate QZS behavior. A mathematical model is developed for studying the nonlinear behavior of the proposed model, and the dynamic equation is solved using Harmonic-Balance method. Further, an experiment is performed to confirm the vibration isolation capability of the proposed model in low-frequency ranges. Stability analysis is performed mathematically using the perturbation analysis. The QZS mechanism obtained here solely depends on the flexible beam\u2019s geometrical configuration, hence making the design strategy material independent.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical metamaterials are attracting considerable attention due to their unique properties not found in natural materials. Advanced geometrical shapes such as Menger cubes, origami templates, and gyroids offer exciting avenues for device engineering. In addition, the recent developments of various additive manufacturing technologies have expanded materials selection and geometrical complexities. Herein, a piezoresistive pressure sensor based on a 3D\u2010printed gyroid structure with a conformal coating of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is presented. The gyroid structures are printed using fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), providing mechanical robustness even at low densities. By altering the relative density of the gyroid structure, Young's modulus can be tailored, ranging from 0.32\u2009MPa at 30% relative density and 3.61\u2009MPa at 80% relative density. The presented gyroid\u2010based pressure sensor achieves a wide sensing range of up to 1.45\u2009MPa and a high sensitivity of 2.68\u2009MPa\u22121. The sensor is integrated into a shoe for wearable applications, demonstrating its mechanical robustness and potential for human stance and motion monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Compliant flexure joints have been widely used for cable-driven soft robotic hands and grippers due to their safe interaction with humans and objects. This paper presents a soft and compliant revolute flexure joint based on the auxetic cellular mechanical metamaterials with a heterogeneous structure. The heterogeneous architecture of the proposed metamaterial flexure joint (MFJ), which is inspired by the human finger joints, provides mechanically tunable multi-stiffness bending motion and large range of bending angle in comparison to conventional flexure joints. The multi-level variation of the joint stiffness over the range of bending motion can be tuned through the geometrical parameters of the cellular mechanical metamaterial unit cells. The proposed flexure joints are 3D printed with single flexible material in monolithic fashion using a standard benchtop 3D printer. The application of the MFJ is demonstrated in robotic in-hand manipulation and grasping thin and deformable objects such as wires and cables. The results show the capability and advantages of the proposed MFJ in soft robotic grippers and highly functional bionic hands.",

    "abstract": "The bandgap tuning potential offered by negative-stiffness lattice structures, characterized by their unique mechanical properties, represents a promising and burgeoning field. The potential of large deformations in lattice structures to transition between stable configurations is explored in this study. This transformation offers a novel method for modifying the frequency range of elastic wave attenuation, simultaneously absorbing energy and effectively generating diverse bandgap ranges. In this paper, an enhanced lattice structure is introduced, building upon the foundation of the normal negative-stiffness lattice structures. The research examined the behavior of the suggested negative-stiffness lattice structures when subjected to uniaxial compression. This included analyzing the dispersion spectra and bandgaps across different states of deformation. It also delved into the effects of geometric parameter changes on bandgap properties. Furthermore, the findings highlight that the normal negative-stiffness lattice structure demonstrates restricted capabilities in attenuating vibrations. In contrast, notable performance improvements are displayed by the improved negative-stiffness lattice structure, featuring distinct energy band structures and variable bandgap ranges in response to differing deformation states. This highlights the feasibility of bandgap tuning through the deformation of negatively stiffened structures. Finally, the overall metamaterial structure is simulated using a unit cell finite element dynamic model, and its vibration transmission properties and frequency response patterns are analyzed. A fresh perspective on the research and design of negative-stiffness lattice structures, particularly focusing on their bandgap tuning capabilities, is offered in this study.",

    "abstract": "Metamaterial absorbers have been widely studied and continuously concerned owing to their excellent resonance features of ultra\u2010thin thickness, light\u2010weight, and high absorbance. Their applications, however, are typically restricted by the intrinsic dispersion of materials and strong resonant features of patterned arrays (mainly referring to narrow absorption bandwidth). It is, therefore essential to reassert the principles of building broadband metamaterial absorbers (BMAs). Herein, the research progress of BMAs from principles, design strategies, tunable properties to functional applications are comprehensively and deeply summarized. Physical principles behind broadband absorption are briefly discussed, typical design strategies in realizing broadband absorption are further emphasized, such as top\u2010down lithography, bottom\u2010up self\u2010assembly, and emerging 3D printing technology. Diversified active components choices, including optical response, temperature response, electrical response, magnetic response, mechanical response, and multi\u2010parameter responses, are reviewed in achieving dynamically tuned broadband absorption. Following this, the achievements of various interdisciplinary applications for BMAs in energy\u2010harvesting, photodetectors, radar\u2010IR dual stealth, bolometers, noise absorbing, imaging, and fabric wearable are summarized. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for future development of BMAs are discussed.",

A growing trend in research is devoted to materials with properties that can be tuned post fabrication in a programmable manner. Such tunability can be achieved through magnetic, electric, or thermal stimuli to responsive elements within the metamaterial's architecture. In this paper, the first experimental demonstration of ferroelectric programmability of 3D printed polymeric metamaterials is presented to control elastic waves using electrical poling. Electrical poling effects are harnessed to change the mechanical properties of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The poling\u2010induced softening is utilized to reverse metamaterials behavior from attenuating waves to propagating them and vice versa. The utility of the proposed platform is demonstrated to program a desired set of pixels within the metamaterials to open a path for waves to propagate in a waveguide. The findings introduce a methodology for elastic wave guiding by electrical poling, which can open the door for numerous applications in various fields such as vibration isolation, wave guiding, and energy harvesting.",

    "abstract": "The unique properties of metamaterials are determined by the configuration and spatial arrangement of artificially designed unit structures. However, the configuration and mechanical properties of conventional metamaterials are challenging to reverse and adjust. Based on curved beams, two types of novel three-dimensional (3D) multi-stable metamaterials with reconfigurable deformation and tunable mechanical properties are designed and fabricated using a four-dimensional (4D) printing method. The effects of temperature and curved-beam thickness on the force-displacement curves and multi-stable snapping sequence of the 3D multi-stable metamaterials are investigated by finite-element analysis (FEA) and experiments. In addition, based on the designed four-branch multi-stable metamaterials, three- and six-branched multi-stable structures are designed by changing the number of curved-beam branches. It is shown that, owing to shape memory effects, the 3D multi-stable metamaterials can realize mechanical programmability, and the multi-stable deformation sequence can be precisely regulated by varying the temperature and curved-beam thickness. These 4D-printed multi-stable metamaterials provide valuable contributions to the design of programmable multi-stable metamaterials and their applications in soft robots and intelligent structures.

    "abstract": "The tunability of multifunctional properties of Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMSs) is mainly constrained to variations in their shell thickness. To address this limitation, a novel approach inspired by 2D cellular solids is introduced, utilizing discrete conformal mapping of perforated 2D cellular layouts onto TPMS surfaces to minimize distortion during 3D mapping. This study focuses on primitive (P)\u2010type Conformally Perforated Shellular Metamaterials (CPSMs), evaluating their thermomechanical and acoustic properties through computational analyses and experimentation on 3D\u2010printed samples. Effective thermomechanical properties are determined via asymptotic homogenization, which demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of CPSMs can be calculated by multiplying the effective thermal conductivities of the 3D shellular and 2D thermally\u2010isotropic cellular architectures. Thermal conductivity and elastic stiffness are systematically enhanced by engineering the shell's in\u2010plane architecture while preserving the 3D topology. The optimized design demonstrates a significant increase in elastic stiffness compared to an intact P\u2010shellular of the same density. Numerical and experimental results reveal that the 2D\u2010mapped architecture effectively tunes the acoustic bandwidth and bandgap frequency range of CPSMs, achieving a 79% increase in bandwidth and a 34% reduction in material density compared to an intact P\u2010shellular. These findings highlight CPSMs' potential for structural, thermal, and acoustic applications, advancing the development of additively manufactured TPMS\u2010based\u00a0multifunctional metamaterials.",

    "abstract": "The majority of polymer-based materials demonstrate expansion upon absorbing water from the air. Mechanical metamaterials provide an interesting way to achieve unusual hygroscopic deformation. However, previous studies have only accommodated the limited tunability of negative hygroscopic expansion by theoretical analysis but have never involved other deformation modes. This work proposes modular reprogrammable 3D moisture-sensitive mechanical metamaterials with switchable hygroscopic deformation modes, which are built up of multi-material 3D-printed bi-material curved strips and cubic nodes. Depending on the geometrical parameters and spatial layouts of the curved strips, the metamaterials exhibit tunable coefficient of hygroscopic expansion from negative to positive. In addition to homogeneous deformation, complex 3D hygroscopic deformation modes can be achieved including shear and twist. More interestingly, the metamaterials are reprogrammable since all the deformation modes can be switched by modular disassembling and reassembling of the curved strips, just like LEGO building blocks. This work demonstrates a feasible approach to achieve customized 3D hygroscopic deformation through easy block building for specific engineering applications including eliminating hygroscopic stress, shape morphing structures, and smart actuators.",
